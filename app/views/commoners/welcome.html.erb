      You may have noticed that your name on <strong>Commonfare.net</strong> is <strong><%= link_to @commoner.name, edit_commoner_path(@commoner) %></strong>.

    <p>
      <strong>Commonfare.net</strong> is constantly growing and more things will come in the next weeks. At the moment you can access the <strong>Welfare Provisions</strong> available in Italy, Croatia and the Netherlands (we call it <%= link_to 'InfoHub', 'http://infohub.commonfare.net' %>), and you can <strong>share a Story</strong> of your own that could be a personal experience, some good practices, or anything you would like that other people know of. You can also respond to other people's Stories by commenting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon you will also be able to create real relations with other Commoners by sharing (and receiving) not only your experience but also time, goods, expertise, etc.
